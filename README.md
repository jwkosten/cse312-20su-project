To run the simulations, first make sure to have all of the imported libraries installed. 

Data for this project is acquired from yahoo finance using the pandas_datareader library. 

Once that is done, run ```python3 stock_sim.py``` to run the simulations. Feel free to change any of the date ranges to see simulations of other times. Please see documentation to see what each of the predict functions parameters do.
